Git is important for version control,
which means that it tracks the changes that you make to your files.
It's also important for collaboration as part of a larger programming team.

The moment you create a workspace using Gitpod, a repository is created on Github.

Storing files in Git is a two-stage process:
First, we need to add our files to what's called the staging area using the "git add" command.
Secondly, we commit them to the repository using the "git commit" command.
1: Adding to the staging area: git add
2: Comitting to the repository: git commit
